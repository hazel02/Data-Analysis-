This data visualization project was developed using Power BI as part of my capstone project at Axia Africa. It aims to analyze healthcare facility data, identify disparities in access to healthcare between rural and urban regions, and evaluate the efficiency of healthcare funding. The objective is to propose data-driven recommendations that governments and stakeholders can implement to enhance healthcare service delivery across Africa
