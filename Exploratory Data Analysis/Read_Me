This repository showcases exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects using Python. It includes two distinct analyses:

1. Mental Health in Tech Survey  
   A mini EDA project based on a publicly available dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey, which explores mental health trends, workplace support, and demographics within the tech industry.

2. Booking Data Analysis for Splendor Hotel  
   A comprehensive EDA project focused on hotel booking data, examining customer behaviors, cancellation patterns, revenue trends, and more to uncover insights that can guide business decisions.

Each project demonstrates data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
